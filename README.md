# SurveyWS

SurveyWS is a simple Web Service developed as a project for my University.

This project sets itself the goal of finding an efficient method to collect and manage computerised surveys by designing and
developing a Web-based Service platform. It has been developed in order to be flexible and adaptable as much as possible to
any context of use.

The technologies involved are:

- [Python](https://www.python.org) 2.7
- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org), a microframework used to build Web Services based on REST architecture.
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org), a self-contained, high-reliability, embedded, full-featured, public-domain, SQL database engine
- [JSON](https://www.json.org) as a standard protocol for exchanging data

The functionalities that this first version of SurveyWS offers are:

- user registration
- user login
- user deletion
- loading of surveys
- showing of all surveys on the platform
- showing of a single survey
- completion of a survey

If, for any reasons, you are interested in this project feel free to contact me.
